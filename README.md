# Preview-Product-Card-Component
This project was built with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
The project Requires use of Media Query of which I am yet to understand and hereby not using in general.
The use of 
section {
    display: flex;
}
 to put the two div stand side by side.
 Also i employed the use of styling this divs by making reference to them as the flex child.
 Other stylles have been considered in terms of hovering state of the button and the active States.
